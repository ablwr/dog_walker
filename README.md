## Background

It's tough to be a dog walker! Luckily, petsitfor.me can help manage your clients and daily schedule, while also providing functionality for owners to view and cancel appointments, leave reviews for walkers, and keep track of their dog or cat's "numbers."

## Features

+ Implemented Devise for secure user authentication and sessions
+ Utilized CarrierWave for image upload and processing
+ Used the Twilio API to allow users to send text messages to other users
+ Developed complex database model with user-restricted layers of information access

## Usage

Rails app to help dog walkers manage their business and facilitate interaction with clients

## Development/Contribution

Wanna write some tests? Wanna chart some poops?

## Future

- Full test coverage
- Better server integration
- Allow owners to make appointments through the application
- Allow walkers to see their schedule past the current day
- Allow poop chart to include info about whether the pet was fed, or peed, and info on all past poops (rather than just the past 7 days)
